# Building a small app with various frameworks

My current approach of building apps is based on fastapi + jinja/html + css + some js.
- Pros: Reliable stack that I'm familiar with
- Cons: Outdated?

Recently, I've been thinking about building apps in js (next.js?) and trying fastHTML, and ran a poll [here](https://x.com/eugeneyan/status/1828447283811402006). This is an extension of the poll, where I'll build the same app thrice using all three approaches, to get a sense of what suits me best.
