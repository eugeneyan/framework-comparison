3,"Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said Kulbhushan Jadhav was ""kidnapped"" and tried on ""concocted charges"".
Mr Jadhav was arrested last year and convicted on Monday of ""espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan"".
Shortly after his arrest, Islamabad released a video in which he was shown admitting involvement in spying.
India has always questioned the alleged confession, saying that it was extracted under duress.
There are differing accounts of how and where Kulbhushan Jadhav was detained.
Pakistan says he was detained on 3 March 2016 in the restive Balochistan province, which has been hit by a separatist insurgency that Islamabad accuses India of backing. India says he was kidnapped by Pakistan while he was in Iran.
Speaking in the Indian parliament on Tuesday, Ms Swaraj described the death sentence as ""an indefensible verdict"" and warned Pakistan to ""consider the consequences"".
Home Minister Rajnath Singh promised that the government would do ""whatever it takes to make sure Mr Jadhav gets justice"".
On Monday, Pakistan said he had been tried by a military court and sentenced to death.
Pakistan said he told the court he had been ordered to ""plan, coordinate, and organise espionage/sabotage activities aiming to destabilise and wage war against Pakistan"".
He has 40 days to appeal to the court, Pakistani media report. No date was given for his execution.
The nuclear-armed neighbours have a long history of diplomatic spats and Delhi and Islamabad often accuse each other of sending spies into their territories.
In November, Pakistan withdrew six officials from its mission in Delhi after they were outed as suspected spies by India.
It later leaked to the press the names and photos of eight alleged Indian spies working from India's mission in Islamabad.
But executions for spying are rare. In 1999, Pakistan hanged Sheikh Shamim 10 years after his conviction for spying.

""They wanted bigger names I think, they took the lad [Di Matteo] and that is how it goes,"" Warnock said ahead of Cardiff's visit to Villa Park.
""I thought at the time that's their loss not mine.""
The 67-year-old continued: ''There were about five clubs I spoke to. You have to look at that when you get to my age.
""I would not be here if one or two of those things had cropped up, but I am really pleased I am here. It is probably fate.""
Warnock had discussions with a number of clubs in the summer, including Nottingham Forest, before joining Cardiff following the departure of Paul Trollope in October.
Trollope has since been appointed assistant manager at Brighton, replacing Colin Calderwood who left to join Bruce at Villa.
After sacking Di Matteo, who lasted just 12 games, Villa opted for former Hull manager Bruce just a week after Warnock had been installed at Cardiff.
Warnock thinks Bruce is the right man to bring success to Villa following their Premier League relegation as he is a similar manager to himself.
''With Steve and myself you get what you see. I was disappointed I did not get a chance with Villa in the summer if I'm honest, because I thought it would have been ideal to sort everything out,"" Warnock told BBC Wales.
""That is why I am not surprised at all Steve has gone in and done really well.

China dismissed the reports as ""hype"", but said it had the right under international law to defend itself.
Several nations claim territory in the resource-rich South China Sea, which is also an important shipping route.
A spokesman for Mr Kerry said satellite images appeared to confirm China had deployed anti-aircraft missiles on Woody or Yongxing Island in the Paracels.
The island is claimed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam and the presence of missiles would significantly increase tensions.

""There is every evidence, every day, that there has been an increase of militarisation from one kind or another. It's a serious concern,"" he said.

But the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, said reports were a Western media invention.
He defended ""the limited and necessary self-defence facilities"" on islands inhabited by Chinese personnel as ""consistent with the right for self-preservation and self-protection.... under the international law"".
China has been carrying out extensive land reclamation work in the region, which it says is legal and for civilian purposes.
But the work has angered other countries which also claim the territory, and there is growing concern about the implications of the area becoming militarised.
The South China Sea dispute has been a topic of debate at a meeting of South East Asian regional leaders in California.
US President Barack Obama said the members had discussed the need for ""tangible steps"" to reduce tensions.
Rival countries have wrangled over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but tension has steadily increased in recent years.
Its islets and waters are claimed in part or in whole by Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.
China has backed its expansive claims with island-building and naval patrols, while the US says it opposes restrictions on freedom of navigation and unlawful sovereignty claims - by all sides, but seen by many as aimed at China.

He defended ""the limited and necessary self-defence facilities"" on islands inhabited by Chinese personnel as ""consistent with the right for self-preservation and self-protection.... under the international law"".
China has been carrying out extensive land reclamation work in the region, which it says is legal and for civilian purposes.
But the work has angered other countries which also claim the territory, and there is growing concern about the implications of the area becoming militarised.
The South China Sea dispute has been a topic of debate at a meeting of South East Asian regional leaders in California.
US President Barack Obama said the members had discussed the need for ""tangible steps"" to reduce tensions.
Rival countries have wrangled over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but tension has steadily increased in recent years.
Its islets and waters are claimed in part or in whole by Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.
China has backed its expansive claims with island-building and naval patrols, while the US says it opposes restrictions on freedom of navigation and unlawful sovereignty claims - by all sides, but seen by many as aimed at China.
The frictions have sparked concern that the area is becoming a flashpoint with global consequences.",Mr Kerry says the US is seriously concerned about increased Chinese militarisation in the contested South China Sea.,2

Mr Joyce has also faced criticism from some politicians who say he should not take a political stance on behalf of the airline.
However, he said his company ""would be active out there"" in campaigning.
""I believe we have to get behind it and make sure that we have a 'yes' vote and certainly I will be out there strongly campaigning for a 'yes' vote,"" he said.
""We believe the social issues are very important of all of your [company] stakeholders and are very important for this country.""
Australians will be asked their views on same-sex marriage through a voluntary, non-binding ballot to begin next month.
If it shows support for changing Australia's Marriage Act, it is expected that a vote in parliament will follow. However, MPs would not be bound to vote in line with the public.
Mr Joyce was one of 20 company chief executives who signed a petition in March calling on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to legalise same-sex marriage.
It led to criticism by Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, who said it was ""unacceptable that people would use companies and the money of publicly-listed companies to throw their weight around"".
""If Alan Joyce and any other CEO wants to campaign on this or any other issue in their own time and on their own dime, good luck to them,"" Mr Dutton said at the time.

35,"Spending on the NHS should also be paid for by a dedicated tax marked on every payslip, the former health minister suggested.
Under Mr Lamb's plan, taxes would not be increased as the new levy would be offset by deductions to income tax or national insurance.
He has warned the NHS faces collapse without an urgent cash injection.
The plans are not yet party policy and will not be put to this year's conference in Bournemouth.
But Mr Lamb, the party's health spokesman, told party members he was ""very interested in the idea of a dedicated NHS and care contribution - separating it out from the rest of taxation, clearly identified on your payslip.
""And I am really interested in the idea of the right for local areas to raise additional funds for the NHS and care if they choose.""
The Lib Dems say he would like to implement the ideas across the UK, although, as health and social care are devolved, it is unclear how this would be enforced.
Mr Lamb - who lost out to Tim Farron in a leadership election in July - proposes a cross-party commission to explore the ideas. He intends to consult health bodies and professionals, patients, trade unions and academics.
Ministers have pledged £2bn in this financial year for the NHS, and an extra £8bn by 2020.
But Mr Lamb told the BBC that this was insufficient and, having ""seen the books"" as a minister in the last government, he feared the NHS could face a funding shortfall of £30bn by 2020.
""The bottom line is with rising demand because of an ageing population we need more investment,"" he said.
Mr Lamb also warned that the social care system was ""on its knees"" and could collapse without a cash injection of £5bn.
""I've been in the department. I have seen the books and I am deeply concerned. If we carry on regardless, the system will crash.""
Taxpayers are already shown how much they have contributed to the health service in annual personal tax statements.

An arts symposium and exhibition at the college runs from Friday to Sunday.

Ministers are also asking the new Strategic Board for Teacher Education to consider whether further actions are needed ""to make sure we have the right numbers of teachers in our schools"".
In September, the leaders of seven councils called for a national taskforce to be set up to help deal with teacher recruitment problems.
They made the call at a summit on tackling teacher shortages in northern and rural parts of Scotland.
Student teacher places next year:
• 1,230 post-graduate primary places - 60 more than last year's target
• 710 undergraduate primary places
• 1,350 secondary places - up by 185 on last year's target
• 200 undergraduate secondary places - 15 more than last year's target
Education Secretary Angela Constance said: ""We want to make sure we have the right number of skilled teachers in our schools to help all of our young people to succeed.
""That's why we worked with local authorities to maintain teacher numbers this year and aim to do the same again next year, with a further £51m funding.
""And it's why we are increasing student places for the fifth year in a row, targeting them at areas where they are needed most such as Aberdeen and Highlands and Islands universities.
""We have upped last year's student teacher targets for science, technology, engineering and maths and we know these will be challenging for the universities to meet.
""I will be asking the new Strategic Board for Teacher Education to look at our workforce planning, particularly in the secondary sector, to consider whether there is more we can do.
""We also launched a teacher recruitment campaign in September with a focus on the Stem subjects and we are working with the universities to maximise its impact.""",The Scottish government has announced a record number of student teacher places for the next financial year.,0
50,"More places will also be made available at all of Scotland's teacher education universities.
The increase of 60 primary and 200 secondary student teacher places will bring the total intake next year to 3,490.

51,"The review of 5,000 studies on golf and wellbeing found physical benefits increased with the player's age.
The study is part of the Gold and Health Project, which is led by the World Golf Foundation.
The project plans to look at gaps in the research such as golf's links to mental health and muscle strengthening.
Executive director of the Golf and Health project Dr Roger Hawkes said the aim had been to add some ""scientific rigour"" to statements made about golf and wellbeing.
""For a number of years we've felt we've underplayed the likely benefits of golf on peoples' health,"" he said.
""We already have a scoping review, outlining what we know already, and we're going to look at that research and the gaps in knowledge so that in five years time we will have really good evidence.""
Having this academically firmed up through in-depth research is going to provide real, tangible resource
Lead researcher Dr Andrew Murray said: ""Evidence suggests golfers live longer than non-golfers, enjoying improvements in cholesterol levels, body composition, wellness, self-esteem and self-worth.
""Given that the sport can be played by the very young to the very old, this demonstrates a wide variety of health benefits for people of all ages.""
The study suggested playing golf could help players meet and exceed minimum government recommendations for moderate to vigorous physical activity.
It claimed that golfers walking 18 holes could cover four to eight miles, while those using an electric golf cart typically chalked up four miles.
Players burned a minimum of 500 calories over 18 holes, it said.
World Golf Foundation CEO Steve Mona said the Golf and Health Project was vital to the development of the sport.
""This project is something we can all get behind, as it is universally agreed that golf is good for you,"" he said.
""Having this academically firmed up through in-depth research is going to provide real, tangible resources that can be used by governments and politicians, professional tours, governing bodies, golf businesses, PGA Professionals and more - all to the sport's benefit.""
The research was released to coincide with the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in St Andrews this week.

Isis social media reports said Asmal, going by the name of Abu Yusuf al-Britani, had taken part in the attack.

Asmal, from Dewsbury, would be Britain's youngest known suicide bomber. Another West Yorkshire teenager, Hasib Hussein, was almost 19 when he blew himself up on a London bus in the 7 July 2005 attacks.
A statement issued by Asmal's family said: ""Talha was a loving, kind, caring and affable teenager.

""Talha's tender years and naivety were it seems however exploited by persons unknown who, hiding behind the anonymity of the world wide web, targeted and befriended Talha and engaged in a process of deliberate and calculated grooming of him.
""Whilst there it appears that Talha fell under the spell of individuals who continued to prey on his innocence and vulnerability to the point where if the press reports are accurate he was ordered to his death by so-called Isis handlers and leaders too cowardly to do their own dirty work.
""We are all naturally utterly devastated and heartbroken by the unspeakable tragedy that now appears to have befallen us.""
West Yorkshire Police said: ""The police have been made aware of media reports with regard to the death of a British National in Iraq.

75,"MI6 and and GCHQ advertised on the Mumsnet website for the first time this year, and MI5 has raised its target for women employees to 45% by 2021.
Flexible working and the importance of ""high emotional intelligence"" are also being stressed in recruitment.
The agencies were responding to calls from MPs to recruit more women.
Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee reported in March 2015 that 37% of intelligence agency staff were women and women only make up 19% of senior civil servants in the agencies.
One year on, the government says that it and the agencies - internal security service MI5, external spy agency MI6 and the government listening post GCHQ - ""agree wholeheartedly"" with the need for ""diversity"" in agency staff.
It says action has been taken since the report was published to ""increase their focus"" on ""all aspects of diversity"", including recruiting more women.
Recruitment targets, ""diversity champions"", events such as a recent ""Women in Cyber"" event and more career support for female officers are part of efforts to employ more women and encourage talented existing women to apply for promotion.
They also say they are doing more to ""promote a flexible working culture"" for men and women with childcare commitments and to allow women returning from maternity leave to take up their old jobs - including in intelligence roles.
The three agencies also said they were always looking for ""new and innovative ways to recruit those with the right skills, mind-set and diversity of approach"".
MI5 had already used Mumsnet as well as local newspapers to target women ""not currently in work"" while the other two agencies did so for the first time this year.
GCHQ has also removed a requirement of a 2:1 university degree from its ""fast-stream"" recruitment to encourage women who had followed a ""non-traditional graduate route"".
The government said the initiatives were having an effect as MI5 had recently been placed in the Times Top 50 employers for women and had increased its number of new female employees by 5% to 46% of new recruits. GCHQ had seen applications from women rise to 40%. MI6 had increased its female recruitment targets for 2016/17 after seeing a 4% drop in women - to 41% of new recruits.

General Khalifa Haftar, who accuses the government of supporting terrorism, began an assault against Islamist fighters in the city last month.
The government in Tripoli says Gen Haftar has no authority to act, but several army units have joined him.
The BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli says a battalion within one of the biggest rival militias has also defected to join the general.
The clashes on Sunday were said to have been some of the worst since Gen Haftar began his offensive against Islamists, dubbed ""Operation Dignity,"" in May.
Residents told the BBC that explosions could be heard across the city intermittently for several hours.
An electricity plant was also hit by rockets, causing power outages in large parts of Benghazi.
Many residents who live in the area where the fighting erupted fled their homes to stay with relatives or friends in quieter neighbourhoods.
The number of casualties remains unclear but doctors in the city said at least six people had been killed and a dozen more injured.
A spokesman for Gen Haftar's force told local media that they had seized several senior Islamists as part of their offensive, but this could not be independently verified.
Since launching his offensive, Gen Haftar has rallied support from the public and members of the security forces.
He survived an assassination attempt earlier in June after a suicide bomb attack on his home in the town of Abyar, about 60km (37 miles) east of Benghazi.
Libya is still in turmoil three years after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, with political, religious and political factions locked in disagreement about the country's future.

Farmers had complained that the Environment Agency was micro-managing flood control.
But academics told BBC News that diverting water off farmland could increase floods where people live.
The policy change was announced Environment Minister Liz Truss at the Oxford Farming Conference after what the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said were two successful pilot schemes.
She said: ""We will allow farmers across the country to maintain their own ditches up to 1.5km in length from April, so they can clear debris and manage the land.""
The decision was welcomed by the National Farmers' Union (NFU).
Its president, Meurig Raymond, said: ""The NFU has pressed Defra and the Environment Agency to enable farmers to undertake minor works for many years.""
But Professor Alan Jenkins from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology said he feared the policy could backfire.
""Waterlogged fields are no use to farmers,"" he said. ""They can't maintain their productivity on waterlogged soil so it makes sense for them to manage their fields accordingly.
""There is a potential downside however, in that if we increase drainage in fields during heavy rainfall it's possible there will be increased and faster transmission of water in the river system with a possible increase in flood risk downstream.""

However, those that remain in circulation will continue to be accepted at shops, banks and cash payment machines.
Bank of Scotland also plans to replace its £10 paper note with a polymer version next year.

Polymer banknotes are made from a very thin, flexible, see-through plastic film, with the design printed on special layers of ink on the front and back.
Because the main material is see-through, the design can include clear spots that are like little windows you can look straight through.

The inquiry in Newport heard the scheme would mean about 105 hectares of designated land, set aside for the protection of water invertebrates, would have to be lost.
The Gwent Levels' unique network of ditches, known as reens, were dug during Roman times and have since become a habitat for a range of rare species.

Dr Jessica Poole, of conservation body Natural Resources Wales (NRW), told the inquiry discussions between the regulator and the Welsh Government meant she was content with the proposed design of the new reens.
But she said there was no guarantee they would work, and it could be some time before they supported the aquatic insects the sites are meant to conserve.
Replicating a complex ecology that has developed over centuries would be ""challenging"", she said.

There has been controversy over Sir Martin's suitability for the role and the areas the inquiry will cover.
The prime minister will set out the terms of reference for the process in the coming weeks.
Downing Street said: ""The prime minister has received the letter and will consider it and respond shortly.""
How far the inquiry can go has been a source of controversy since the Sir Martin's appointment was announced.
He angered survivors on his first day in the job by indicating the investigation would be ""pretty well limited"" to examining the cause of the fire, how it spread and how to prevent future incidents.
But he later vowed to consider a ""broad range of evidence"" which could include why residents' warnings about fire safety were allegedly ignored by authorities.
Survivors, bereaved families and other involved parties spent weeks making their case about what questions the inquiry should answer.
More than 400 submissions were received during the consultation period.
The ""Justice 4 Grenfell"" campaign said earlier this month it wanted an examination of local and national social housing policy and whether it ""increased risks to residents"".
Questions were raised in the aftermath of the disaster about the cladding used on Grenfell and other buildings. More than 100 buildings have failed the latest fire safety tests set in the wake of the fire.
Sir Martin has previously faced calls to resign from residents, while Labour MP David Lammy said he was a ""white, upper-middle class man"" who had ""never"" visited a tower block housing estate and should not have been appointed.
The inquiry is due to start in September. Sir Martin has previously said an interim report could be produced within a year.

193,"Police raided 43-year-old John Nicholson's Dundee home in February following a tip-off.
Officers found drugs including more than 2.5 kg of heroin with a street value of £263,000 during the operation.
Nicholson will be sentenced on 11 May after admitting being concerned in the supply of drugs at his home in the city's Raglan Street.
Defence counsel Ronnie Renucci said Nicholson pled guilty on the basis that he had allowed his house to be used for the storage of the drugs.
Mr Renucci said: ""He was not the owner of the drugs. He was doing so to pay off a debt.""
The High Court in Edinburgh was told police officers also recovered £100,000 worth of amphetamine and cannabis with a potential street value of between £60,000 and £90,000.
The court heard that Nicholson had previous convictions for road traffic offences and dishonesty but had never been jailed.
Lord Kinclaven deferred sentence on Nicholson for reports and remanded him in custody.","A man has admitted being concerned in the supply of heroin with a street value of more than £300,000.",0

195,"Bakehouse Close and Riddle's Close - once home to philosopher David Hume - are among those selected for a makeover by Edinburgh World Heritage.
Fleshmarket Close, which is famously a setting for an Inspector Rebus novel, has also made the final list.
Lighting and artwork will be installed in the little-used closes.
The people behind the project hope the improvements will encourage more people to use the historic network of narrow streets.
Adam Wilkinson, the director of Edinburgh World Heritage, said: ""Our aim is for this project to re-connect the people of Edinburgh with the closes of the Old Town.
""The intricate network of closes and courtyards that bind the Old Town together gives it a unique identity, is underused but has the opportunity to be revitalised, used and celebrated by all.""
The closes date back to the medieval origins of the city.
Originally, individual plots of land were set up lining the main street, with paths to gain access to the land behind.
As each plot became built up over time, so they developed into narrow lanes connecting courtyards and streets behind the Royal Mile.
The Twelve Closes project was welcomed by city leaders, including John Thompson, of the Old Town community council.
He said: ""This is a project to be welcomed, changing dilapidated and neglected closes into useful routes linking different parts of the Old Town.
""The closes were once busy thoroughfares, buzzing with all the life of the city, and it would be wonderful to see some of that atmosphere return.""","Several of Edinburgh's ""dilapidated and neglected"" closes are to be transformed as part of a major project to improve the Old Town.",2

He joins team-mate Shaun Cleary, who has been banned for two years as benzoylecgonine, a cocaine metabolite, was found in his system.
Both players tested positive before a friendly against Bridgend Ravens RFC.
UKAD Director of Legal, Graham Arthur said: ""Ryan Watkins deliberately ingested nandrolone and methylhexaneamine without any consideration for his responsibilities as an athlete.
""By making this conscious choice to dope, Watkins has chosen to cheat his team-mates, the opposition and his sport.
""I hope this case will act as strong deterrent to other young amateur players - the risks to your playing career, your reputation and more importantly to your health, just aren't worth it.""
Speaking about Cleary, Mr Arthur said:  ""Although Mr Cleary used cocaine three days before playing, cocaine was still in his system when he played.
""Cocaine is banned from sport and athletes are solely responsible for what is in their system, regardless of whether there is an intention to cheat or not.""
Welsh Rugby Union chief executive Martyn Phillips said about Cleary: ""This case serves as a strong warning to everyone in the game that non-compliance with anti-doping rules carries grave consequences.
""Whether intentional, or inadvertent, players have a responsibility to themselves, to each other, to their clubs and to the sport to act within the rules and spirit of the game.
""We work closely with UK Anti-Doping and fully adhere to the World Anti-Doping Code. There is no room in the code for carelessness or not knowing.

199,"The Acting Up report suggests the high audition costs for drama school is one of several factors deterring people from working class backgrounds from entering the arts.
It also recommends more school trips to the theatre to encourage young pupils.
The government said it was a ""priority"" to ensure everyone can take part in the arts and culture, including in schools.
Former Coronation Street and EastEnders actress Tracy Brabin, who was first elected as an MP in by election last year, led the inquiry along with fellow Labour MP Gloria De Piero, who worked as a presenter on GMTV before becoming a politician.
Ms Brabin, whose best-known role was as single mother Tricia Armstrong in Coronation Street from 1994 to 1997, said there was a ""diversity crisis on our stages and screens"".
The report, commissioned by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson, looked at what more could be done at school level to encourage young people to consider a career in the arts.
It said that drama, and other related subjects, are often treated as inferior at some schools - and that students are sometimes discouraged from studying them.
It also suggested there are poor drama facilities, few arts excursions and a lack of awareness about arts career opportunities in many schools.
Ms Brabin, who also worked as a TV writer in her pre-political life, said: ""Our performing arts are some of the best in the world and they should represent our whole nation, not just a privileged section of it.
""But the systematic eradication of arts education in schools, sky-high drama school audition fees, chronic low pay and a lack of diversity behind the scenes are all contributing to a diversity crisis on our stages and screens.""
The publication of the report follows comments made by presenter Anita Rani last week, who said the pay gap among the BBC's top talent was as much about race and class as gender.
A government spokesman said it was investing Â£300m between 2016 and 2020 to encourage young people to participate in music and arts.
He said: ""We are completely committed to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to take part in arts and culture, including in schools.""
